Last week I studied some old neural network models that aren't widely used anymore, e.g. Hopfield networks. This post is meant to be a rough record of what I studied and hopefully could serve as a rough reference for others who are interested. I cover the follwing:
- Hopfield network
- Boltzmann machine
- Helmholtz machine
- Deep belief network
- Predictive coding network and how it related to backprop

*Note: I don't dive into the intricate history of the development of these models. You can probably read any one of Schmidhuber's Twitter threads for that.*
