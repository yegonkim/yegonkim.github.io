One reason why rigor is often prioritized over legibility in mathematical proofs, is because correctness is the most important thing in math, and writing a proof rigorously allows one to check for any errors, and for others to check for errors. In other words, a written proof had the burden of 1) being verifiable and 2) conveying the insights to the readers.

With formal verifiers and autoformalizers, things will change drastically. The mathematical texts will no longer be required to be scrutinizable, because it will come along with a formal proof written in Lean.

It's useful to make an analogy to the current state of vibe-coding and its future.
Most menial coding tasks are now handed over to coding AIs,
only the most complicated, big-picture tasks require human insights.

What's crazy is that vibe proving doesn't inherit the single most critical problem of vibe-coding: that it sometimes take as much, or even more time, to write a verifier for a code, e.g. test cases. In math, this would be coming up with formal definitions and conjectures. This is what mathematicians have to do when they invent a new field of math.
