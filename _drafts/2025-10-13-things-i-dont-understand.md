I find myself confused about a number of problems and ideas, as to why so many people *care about them*, e.g. the hard problem of consciousness. Whether something is important or not is a subjective matter: there's no *problem* in that many people find something important while I don't, just as two different RL agents can have different terminal goals. Not *understanding* why many people find a problem important, however, is a different matter, one that can be framed as an objective problem.
<!-- And for me, and probably most human beings, understanding someone else's feelings at a very deep level often evokes an emotional response in onself (empathy, basically).  -->

My adolescent self tended to think that it was everyone else who was confused, not me, and that those problems or ideas are trivial, ill-posed, or useless. As I grew up, however, I had several experiences of finding something important that I previously categorized as trivial or useless. Every such experience opened up a whole new area of interesting thoughts, making me regret that I hadn't looked into it earlier. After a few more of those experiences, I learned a lesson that if many people find something important, there must be a very good reason for it, and that the ideas are probably not trivial or useless.
