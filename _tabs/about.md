Hi, I am a PhD student studying artificial intelligence at KAIST, working on LLM reasoning and AI alignment. From time to time, I latch onto some interesting problem or idea and think about it for a while. I then write down those thoughts as blog posts here. Other times, I write educational posts that are meant to be helpful to other students, e.g. of physics.
