Hi, I am Yegon (pronounced Yeh-gon), a PhD student researching artificial intelligence at KAIST. I write posts about interesting problems or ideas after I think about them for a while. I also write educational posts, e.g. on physics.

I have a passion for building technology that can empower individuals, in particular by helping them better *understand* the world. From a reductionist point of view, this is a problem of influencing/controlling/assisting humans so that they achieve a certain mental state, namely one with a better understanding. Imbuing AIs with a strong theory of mind would therefore be extremely helpful. However, such technology poses some unique risks such as malicious usage, or strong reward tampering, which should be investigated in parallel. Some other directions I'm interested in are AIs that can make accurate and calibrated predictions of future events, a.k.a. AI superforecasters [[1]](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12036)[[2]](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/65cbaa304b09ee7d7ae160d5/t/6852b3b19ab53130c3406998/1750250443227/bench-to-the-future.pdf)[[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19477)[[4]](https://safe.ai/blog/forecasting)[[5]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uGkRcHqatmPkvpGLq/contra-papers-claiming-superhuman-ai-forecasting)[[6]](https://futuresearch.ai/research/), AIs that can enhance collective intelligence by facilitating communication between humans [[7]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03690)[[8]](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/65220/), and scalable oversight [[9]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03540)[[10]](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hw2tGSsvLLyjFoLFS/scalable-oversight-and-weak-to-strong-generalization).
