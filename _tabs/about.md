Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying **mathematics** at KAIST. I am also broadly interested in **artificial intelligence** and **neuroscience**.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano or listening to music, mostly jazz.

I am currently at EPFL for an exchange semester, and will head back to Korea in February!
