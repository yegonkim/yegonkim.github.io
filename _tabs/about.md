Hello! I am a Master's student studying machine learning at KAIST under the guidance of professor Juho Lee. I received a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, at the same school.

I am currently working on the intersection of active learning and PDE emulators, in the hope of accelerating scientific discoveries. I am also broadly interested in reasoning capabilities of AI and rigorous, scientific approaches to understanding large models.

In my free time, I enjoy researching about stuff that interests me, which are mostly AI or neuroscience-related, or playing/listening to jazz.
