Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying **mathematics** at KAIST (Dajeon, South Korea). I am broadly interested in the applications of maths to **artificial intelligence** and **neuroscience**.



I have lived in four countries, namely Japan (3 years), France (4 years), China(7 years), and South Korea.
