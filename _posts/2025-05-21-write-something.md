Looking back at my blog, I realize that I have written, on average, 1 post per 6 months. If I don't count the posts that I deleted, that reduces to 1 post per year. Having so much thoughts all the time, I thought that I would write a bit more than that. What happened? The biggest reason is that most of my thoughts are not 

in retrospect, the stuff I've been interested in since undergraduate years turned out to be some pretty important stuff.
i feel like the raw thoughts I had back then were (well, some of them) original and insightful, which I didn't agree with back then.


jazz and dopamine - its relation to studying math


Benefits of writing:
- Writing something gives people a sense of who I am, what I'm interested in, and what I'm doing.
- Writing something gives me a better sense of who I am, what I'm interested in, and what I'm doing.
- Writing something 



Rules:
- I will publish a post if I write at least 300 words.
- I will not be afraid of being judged on how smart I am.
- I will not be obsessed with filling a post with my original thoughts. In fact, I will find at least one other reference related to the post, and summarize it in my own words.
- If I'm not satisfied with the post, I will write concrete plans on what I should research or study to improve the post.
- I will not delete a post if I don't publish it.


I will publish this post if I write at least 10 more posts from now on.
