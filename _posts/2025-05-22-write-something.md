When starting this blog, I thought I would be writing a bit more than I am doing right now. What happened? One reason is that it's not as rewarding as I initially thought, and the second reason is that I don't have many thoughts that are worth writing more than ten sentences about. In retrospect, I regret not writing as much as I could have, because:
1. Writing them out would have laid a clear picture of what I have been interested in.
2. Some of those thoughts were actually more insightful than I felt like back then.
3. Writing them can be rewarding, if I let down my expectations and the fear of being judged.

To avoid falling back to the same pattern of not writing, I will set out some rules for myself. These rules are not meant to constrain, but to inspire and motivate me to write without being too self-aware.
1. I will not be obsessed with filling a post with my original thoughts.\
   In fact, I will find at least one other reference related to the post, and summarize it in my own words.
2. 700 characters suffices for a post.
3. If I feel an urge not to publish the post, I will still publish it and write concrete plans on what I should research or study to improve it.
